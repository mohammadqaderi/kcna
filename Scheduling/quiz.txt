 server or other Kubernetes cluster components?
 Solution: Static pods

Q-13: When using the kubelet alone, without involving other Kubernetes control plane components, it is possible to create
 replicas, deployments, or services.
 Solution: False

Q-14: What is one way to manually assign a node to an existing pod in Kubernetes by mimicking the behavior of the scheduler?
 Solution: Create a binding object with the target node’s name and send a post request to the pod’s binding API.

Q-15: What is the purpose of the NodeName field in a Kubernetes pod?
 Solution: It represents the name of the node where the pod is scheduled to run.

Q-16: Which Kubernetes resource ensures that a copy of a pod is automatically added to each node in
 a cluster, including newly added nodes?
 Solution: DaemonSet

Q-17: What is the key distinction between a DaemonSet and a ReplicaSet?
 Solution: A DaemonSet ensures that a copy of a pod runs on every node in a Kubernetes cluster, while a ReplicaSet maintains
 a specified number of pod replicas across the cluster.

Q-18: How is 1 count of CPU (1 CPU) defined in Kubernetes?
 Solution: All the options are valid
 - It refers to 1 Hyperthread.
 - It refers to 1 core in GCP or Azure.
 - It refers to 1 vCPU in AWS.

Q-19: What is the minimum value that can be set for CPU resource requests in Kubernetes?
 Solution: 1m CPU

Q-20: What is the primary purpose of using annotations in Kubernetes?
 Solution: To record additional details or metadata for informational purposes

Q-21: Which command can be used to display all the created DaemonSets in a Kubernetes cluster?
 Solution: kubectl get daemonsets

Q-22: Which of the following is a suitable use case for deploying a DaemonSet in Kubernetes?
 Solution: Deploying a monitoring agent or log collector on each node in the cluster

Q-23: What approach can be used to specify the path for static pod definition files when not directly
 specifying it in the kubelet.service file?
 Solution: Creating a separate config file and defining the directory path as ‘staticPodPath’

Q-24: How can you ensure complete dedication of nodes for specific pods in Kubernetes?
 Solution: By using a combination of taints, tolerations, and node affinity rules

Q-25: How can you limit a pod to run on a specific node in Kubernetes?
 Solution: Add a label to the node and use nodeSelector in the pod’s spec section.

Q-26: What does the type of node affinity in Kubernetes define?
 Solution: The behavior of the scheduler in relation to node affinity and the stages of the pod lifecycle.

Q-27: What are the key distinctions between static pods and DaemonSets in Kubernetes?
 Solution: All the options are valid
 - Static pods can be used to deploy control plane nodes, while DaemonSets are suitable for deploying monitoring or logging agents on each node.
 - Static pods are created using kubelet, while DaemonSets utilize kubeapi-server.
 - Both static pods and DaemonSets are ignored by the kube-scheduler.

Q-28: Which statement accurately describes the behavior of a static pod in a Kubernetes cluster?
 Solution: When a kubelet creates a static pod, it also creates a read-only mirror object in the Kube API server.

Q-29: What are the two types of node affinity available in Kubernetes?
 Solution: requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution, preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution

Q-30: The kubectl utility relies on the presence of the Kubernetes API server, and if the API server is
 not available, kubectl commands will not work.
 Solution: True

Q-31: What is a potential use case for static pods in a Kubernetes cluster?
 Solution: Deploying control plane components as pods on the master nodes

Q-32: What limitation exists when using NodeSelectors in Kubernetes?
 Solution: NodeSelectors can only handle simple queries and cannot handle complex queries like OR or NOT.

Q-33: How can you taint a node in Kubernetes using the kubectl command?
 Solution: kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect

Q-34: What is the difference between “Gigabyte (GB)” and “Gibibyte (GiB)” in terms of their size?
 Solution: Gigabyte (GB) refers to 1000 Megabytes, while Gibibyte (GiB) refers to 1024 Mebibytes.

Q-35: What is the default assumption made by Kubernetes regarding the resource request for a container?
 Solution: 0.5 CPU and 256 MiB memory

Q-36: What can be done to manually schedule a pod to a specific node in Kubernetes when there is
 no scheduler monitoring and scheduling the nodes?
 Solution: Set the NodeName field in the pod manifest to the desired node name.

Q-37: Which of the following is a taint effect in Kubernetes?
 Solution: NoSchedule

Q-38: In Kubernetes, what mechanism allows you to filter and view different objects based on categories or criteria,
 such as their type, application, or functionality?
 Solution: Labels and selectors

Q-39: Where are the labels defined for the pods in a ReplicaSet?
 Solution: Under the template section of the Replicaset definition file.

Q-40: To connect a ReplicaSet to the desired pods, which field in the ReplicaSet specification is used to
 match the labels defined on the pod?
 Solution: selector

Q-41: What do the labels at the top of a Replicaset definition file represent?
 Solution: Labels of the Replicaset itself.

Q-42: What is the purpose of taints and tolerations in Kubernetes?
 Solution: Taints are added to nodes to define which pods they can tolerate, while tolerations are added to pods
 to allow them to be scheduled on specific nodes.

Q-43: What capability does the node affinity feature provide in Kubernetes?
 Solution: It enables complex queries like OR, IN, NOT, and EXISTS for limiting pod placement on specific nodes.

Q-44: How can you change the default resource limit for containers in Kubernetes?
 Solution: Add a ‘limit’ section under the resources section in the pod definition file.

Q-45: What does the taint effect determine for pods that do not tolerate the taint in Kubernetes?
 Solution: The scheduling behavior of the pods

Q-46: Where is the location specified for the kubelet to look for static pod definition files?
 Solution: The --pod-manifest-path parameter in the kubelet.service file
