- To achieve cloud native autoscaling, three factors are essential:
1. Both the application and the infrastructure must be designed to scale effectively.
2. Autoscaling must be automatic.
3. Autoscaling must be bidirectional; to scale up and down

1. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
2. Vertical Pod Autoscaler
3. Cluster Autoscaler
