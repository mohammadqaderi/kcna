- The VPA automatically adjusts the amount of CPU and memory allocated to the pods in response to changing conditions.

- The VPA has three components:
 1. VPA Recommender
 - Monitor the resource usage of the pod from the metrics server
 2. VPA Updater
 - Once the recommender has made its recommendations, The VPA updater checks the current state of the pod.
 - It sees that the pod's current resource allocation does not match the recommender suggestion.
 - If the updater notices that there's a difference, it'll take the necessary actions to align the pod's resources
   with the recommended suggestions.
 - Note: the updater can't change the resource request of the running pod directly.
 - The updater's way of implementing the recommender's suggestion is to evict the pod
 - The kubernetes scheduler then automatically creates a new pod.
 - When the new pod is created, it goes through the kubernetes admission process (This is where the VPA admission controller
   comes in).
 - The VPA admission controller intercepts the new pod creation request and updates the pod's resource request to align
   with the recommender's suggestions.
 - There's a configuration property called updateMode which handles three possible values:
   - Off: means the VPA will not automatically update the resource request of the pods.
   - Initial: Allows the VPA to update the resource request of the pods but only when they're first created
   - Auto: Allows the VPA to automatically update the resource request of the pods both when they're first created and
     throughout their lifecycle

- Check how to deploy VPA in the attached image.
