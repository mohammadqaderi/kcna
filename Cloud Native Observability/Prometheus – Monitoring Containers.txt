- Metrics can also be scraped from containerized environments
- Docker Engine Metrics
- Container metrics using cAdvisor

- Docker Engine Metrics
  - Add this file: vi /etc/docker/daemon.json
  {
    "metrics-addr": "127.0.0.1:9323",
    "experimental": true
  }
  - sudo systemctl restart docker
  - curl localhost:9323/metrics


- Docker Metrics vs cAdvisor Metrics
  - Docker Metrics:
    - How much cpu does docker use
    - Total number of failed image builds
    - Time to process container actions
    - No metrics specific to a container
  - cAdvisor Metrics:
    - How much cpu/mem does each container use
    - Number of processes running inside a container
    - Container uptime
    - Metrics on a per-container basis
