- Observability: the ability to understand and measure the state of the system based upon data generated by the
  system.
- Observability allows you to generate actionable outputs from unexpected scenarios in dynamic environments.

- Observability will help in:
  - Give better insight into the internal working of a system/application.
  - Speed up troubleshooting
  - Detect hard to catch problems
  - Monitor performance of an application
  - Improve cross-team collaboration

- Them main purpose of observability is to better understand the internals of your system

- Three pillars of observability:
  - Logging
  - Metrics
  - Traces
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Logs
- Logs are records of events that have occurred and encapsulate information about the specific events.
  - Logs are comprised of:
    - Timestamp of when the log occurred
    - Message containing information
  - Logs are the most common form of observation produced by the system

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Traces

- Traces allow you to follow operations as they traverse through various system and services
- We can follow an individual request and see it flow through our system hop by hop
- Traces help us connect the dots on how processes and services work together
- Each trace has a trace-id that can be used to identify a request as it is traverses the system
- Individual events forming a trace are called spans
- Each span tracks the following:
  - Start Time
  - Duration
  - Parent-id

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Metrics
- Metrics provide information about the state of a system using numerical values
  - CPU Load
  - Number of open files
  - HTTP response time
  - Number of errors
- The data collected can be aggregated over time and graphed using virtualization tools to identify trends over time.
- Metrics contain 4 pieces of information:
  - Metric name
  - Value - most recent or current value of the metric
  - Timestamp of the metric
  - Dimensions - additional information about the metric
