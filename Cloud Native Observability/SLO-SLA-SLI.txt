- SLI (Service Level Indicator): quantitative measure of some aspect of the level of service that is provided.
- Common SLIs:
  - Request latency
  - Error rate
  - Saturation
  - Throughput
  - Availability
- Not all metrics make for good SLIs. you want to find metrics that accurately measure a user's experience.
- Things like high-cpu/high-memory make for a poor SLIs as a user might not see any impact in their end during these events.

- SLO (Service Level Object): target value or range for an SLI.
  SLI - Latency
  SLO - Latency < 100ms

  SLI - Availability
  SLO - 99.9% uptime

- SLOs should be directly related to customer experience. the main purpose of the SLO is to quantify reliability of
  a product to a customer
- For SLOs, it is maybe tempting to set them to aggressive values like 100% uptime, however, this will come
  at a higher cost
- The goal is not to achieve perfection, but instead to make customers happy with the right level of reliability.
- If a customer is happy with 99% reliability increasing it any further doesn't add any other value

- SLA (Service Level Agreement): contract between a vendor and a user that guarantees a certain SLO
- The consequences for not meeting any SLO can be financial based but can also be variety of other things as well
