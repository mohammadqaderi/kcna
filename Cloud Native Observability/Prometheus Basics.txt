- Prometheus is an open-source monitoring tool that collects metrics data, and provide tools to visualize the collected data.

- In addition, Prometheus allows you to generate alerts when metrics reach a user specified threshold

- Prometheus collects metrics by scraping targets who expose metrics through an HTTP endpoint
