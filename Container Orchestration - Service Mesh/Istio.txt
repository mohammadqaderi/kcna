- Istio is a free and open source service mesh that provides an efficient way to secure, connect and monitor services.

- Istio works with Kubernetes and traditional workloads.

- Istio implements these proxies using an open source and high performance proxy known as Envoy.
  And the proxies talked to a server-side component known as control plane.

- The controlplane consists of three components:
  - Pilot: help with service discovery
  - Citadel: manage certificate generation
  - Galley: validate configuration files

- The three components combined into a single daemon called Istiod

- Each service or pod has a separate component on it along with Envoy proxy called the Istio Agent.

- The Istio Agent is responsible for passing the configuration secrets to the Envoy proxies.

- Install istio using istioctl
  istioctl install --set profile=demo -y
  istioctl verify-install
