Q-3: What is the primary function of Envoy?
 Solution: Acting as a proxy and communication bus.

Q-4: In a service mesh architecture, what is the role of the control plane?
 Solution: It manages all the traffic into and out of services via proxies.

Q-5: Which of the following is true about a proxy service in an application architecture?
 Solution:

Q-6: Which three components were originally part of the control plane in Istio?
 Solution: Citadel, Pilot, and Galley

Q-7: How does Kubernetes services identify and select specific pods from a large pool of other pods?
 Solution: By using pod labels

Q-8: What is the role of a service mesh in a microservice architecture?
 Solution: It is a dedicated and configurable infrastructure layer that handles the communication between services without code changes.

 Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)?
 Solution: It reached the graduation level in 2018.

Q-14: What is the key difference between a LoadBalancer service and a NodePort service in Kubernetes?
 Solution: LoadBalancer services require the use of an external load balancer, while NodePort services do not.
