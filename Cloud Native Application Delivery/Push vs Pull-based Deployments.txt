Push Based Model
- An external system such as a continuous delivery pipeline triggers deployments to the kubernetes cluster after
  a successful commit to a Git repository or a previous CI pipeline.
- This external system or CI pipeline has direct read-write access to the cluster, allowing you to push the changes
  to the production environment.
- If you want to use this approach, you will need to expose the cluster credentials outside the cluster and store them
  in the CI system.

  associated Git repositories and Docker registries for changes and if a change is detected the operator updates the
  cluster's data accordingly.
- One of benefit of pull-based approach is it's inherit security
